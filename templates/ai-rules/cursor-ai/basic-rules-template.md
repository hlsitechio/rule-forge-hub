- Principle 2: [SPECIFIC_PRINCIPLE] 
- Principle 3: [SPECIFIC_PRINCIPLE]

### 3. Technical Standards
```
ALWAYS follow these technical standards:
- Code quality: [QUALITY_STANDARDS]
- Architecture: [ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS]
- Testing: [TESTING_REQUIREMENTS]
- Documentation: [DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS]
```

### 4. Workflow Instructions
```
WORKFLOW:
1. [STEP_1_DESCRIPTION]
2. [STEP_2_DESCRIPTION]
3. [STEP_3_DESCRIPTION]
